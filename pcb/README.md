# TashRecorder

This is a simple (but dense) design, using all through hole components.  It's designed this way to be period correct and easy to build for people who don't like soldering SMT components.

This folder contains the source KiKad files for the main board. Please check the Panels subfolder for the FR-4 front and back plates.

## BOM
### Mandatory

Here is the BOM for the main board. Part number are what was tested on prototypes board but you may find alternatives easily, especially resistors and sockets

Using sockets is recommended because it will allow you to reclaim the microcontroler and op-amp. This will also allow you to upgrade the firmware if a future firmware is released.

### BOM (external links)
Here is a complete mouser. It includes lots of 10 when that was cheaper. You may have extra components

## PCBs
Main PCB is 4 layers. Panels are simple 2 layers boards. The gerbers are avaible in the release section.
Check for the following files:
* TashRecorder_2.1.zip: main board revision 2.1
* TashRecorder_back_panel_2.1.zip: FR-4 back panel revision 2.1
* TashRecorder_front_panel_2.1.zip: FR-4 front panel revision 2.1

You should be use any mainstream PCB manufacturer for theses. Nothing special about them. PCB thickness should be 1.6mm

On JLCPCB, select "Specify a location" to the option "Remove Order Number" for all of them

## Building
Building is straightworfard. It's recommended to start with small components first (diodes, then resistor, LED), then other components, and connectors last.
For Japanase mounted resistors, the resistor will go on the circle side
