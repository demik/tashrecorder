# TashRecorder

## Elevator Pitch

It's a clone of the Farallon MacRecorder, an audio interface for vintage Macintosh computers without audio input, targeting the PIC12F1501 (8 pins, ~$0.96) microcontroller.

## Building Firmware

Building the firmware requires Microchip MPASM, which is included with their development environment, MPLAB.  Note that you **must** use MPLAB X version 5.35 or earlier or MPLAB 8 as later versions of MPLAB X have removed MPASM.
